    <div class="poem">
      <p>I have not yet held your hand,
Nor walked with you across the sand.
But in my heart, you’re already near,
A gentle voice I long to hear.

The map is wide, the road is long,
And distance hums a lonely song,
But space is just a hollow frame
Around the gold that bears your name.
I watch the stars from where I stand,
And wonder if they’ve touched your land,
Tracing the light that travels through
The vastness separating me from you.

I do not know the way you smile,
Or how you’ll pause a little while,
But in the quiet of the night,
You are my softest, truest light.
I imagine how the air will change,
When nothing’s far or out of range—
When the silhouette I’ve learned to trace
Becomes the warmth of your embrace.

There are words we haven't spoken yet,
A thousand scenes we haven't set,
But I have felt the phantom pull
Of a life that’s finally, deeply full.
I’ve memorized a soul unseen,
And loved the spaces in between,
Finding a home in what will be,
Waiting for you to come to me.

So I will wait for time to fold,
For all the stories yet untold,
Until the day the dream rings true,
And I am finally holding you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I dream of you in quiet nights,
A star that shines with endless light.
Though I have not yet seen your face,
I feel your warmth, your gentle grace.
I look at the moon and wonder if you
Are tracing the curve of its silver hue,
Linking our gazes across the black,
A path for the heart with no turning back.
You are the pulse in the midnight air,
The answer to every unspoken prayer,
And though you are light-years out of my reach,
You’re the lesson in patience that life had to teach.
So I’ll navigate by the glow that you cast,
Knowing the distance is fleeting and fast,
Until the dawn breaks and the shadows depart,
And I find the star living inside of my heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>We stand apart, two souls unknown,
Yet love has found a way to grow.
No stories shared, no past to bind,
But still you linger in my mind.
It’s a tether of silk, a wire of gold,
A story of us that is yet to be told,
Stretching through cities and valleys and rain,
A healing that comes long before any pain.
I haven’t a memory of how you might look,
But I’ve read every page of your soul like a book,
Finding the rhythms and hidden designs
That live in the silence between all the lines.
Though we are strangers by name and by birth,
I’m tethered to you through the spin of the earth,
Growing toward you like a vine to the sun,
Loving you now, though we’ve barely begun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I do not know the path you take,
Or how your mornings gently wake.
But still I feel you close to me,
A love that waits patiently.
Do you walk through the woods where the pine needles lay?
Do you breathe in the mist at the start of the day?
I imagine the coffee, the steam, and the light,
The way that you shake off the chill of the night.
I am learning the map of a country unseen,
The valleys of "maybe" and "might have been,"
Knowing that every wrong turn that I make
Is leading me closer to the road that you take.
I’ll wait at the crossroads, I’ll wait by the gate,
I’ll barter with time and I’ll bargain with fate,
For I know that the horizon is hiding the view
Of the morning I finally wake up with you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I write to you with hope and care,
Though I don’t know the clothes you wear.
I’ve never seen your gentle eyes,
But still I dream beneath the skies.
I wonder if blue is the shade that you choose,
Or if you walk barefoot and throw off your shoes;
I wonder what colors you carry inside,
What dreams you have nurtured and what you have hide.
This letter is written on wind and on stone,
To a person I’ve loved while I’ve sat all alone,
An ink made of longing, a pen made of fire,
The steady refrain of a lifelong desire.
One day I will hand you this bundle of years,
The collection of laughter, the bottles of tears,
And you’ll read in the margin of every new day:
“I loved you before I had words I could say.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I wonder how your laughter feels,
What stories all your silence seals.
Though I have not yet heard your voice,
My heart has made its tender choice.
It chose you in moments of quiet and crowds,
It chose you in sunshine and under the clouds;
It didn’t need proof or a hand I could hold,
To know that your spirit was courage and gold.
I listen for echoes in halls where I go,
Searching for melodies I’ve yet to know,
A certain vibration, a hum in the chest,
That tells me my searching can finally rest.
I have elected a ghost to be king,
To wait for the joy that a presence can bring,
Trusting the instinct that whispers so true:
“The best part of me is the part meant for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’ve never touched your gentle hand,
Or walked with you across the land.
But still I feel your spirit near,
A quiet love that’s crystal clear.
It’s the brush of a sleeve when the hallway is bare,
A scent on the wind like you’ve just been right there,
A phantom companionship, steady and deep,
That stays by my side while the weary world sleeps.
We haven't climbed mountains or waded through streams,
But we’ve conquered the kingdom of infinite dreams,
And though I can't feel the weight of your stride,
I feel you like gravity—pulling the tide.
The earth is a theater, the stage is set wide,
With nowhere for two destined spirits to hide;
So walk toward me slowly, or run if you must,
I am waiting right here with a heart full of trust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I do not know the sound you make,
Or how your mornings softly wake.
But still I dream of you each night,
A gentle flame, a guiding light.
I wonder if your voice is low and deep,
Like secrets that the ancient forests keep,
Or if it rings with bells of sudden mirth,
The brightest music ever heard on earth.
Do you wake with a sigh or a sudden start?
Does the dawn bring a heavy or hopeful heart?
I am learning the rhythm of your bated breath,
A devotion that defies both distance and death.
You are the flicker in the corner of my eye,
The steady glow beneath a restless sky,
And though your melody is yet unknown,
My soul has claimed your music as its own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I wonder where your footsteps fall,
What dreams you chase, what hopes you call.
Though I have not yet seen your face,
I feel your warmth, your gentle grace.
Are you walking through streets of a crowded town,
While the amber sun is sinking slowly down?
Or do you stand where the wild grass grows,
Where the secret wind of the mountain blows?
I track the print of a phantom shoe,
Across the world in search of you,
Believing that the earth is curved and small,
And eventually, we’ll scale the same stone wall.
I don't need a mirror to know your worth,
Or a map to prove you walk this earth;
I feel the heat of your spirit’s flame,
Calling me home before I know your name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’ve never heard your gentle tone,
Or walked with you when day is done.
But still I feel you close to me,
A love that waits patiently.
When the shadows stretch and the blue hour fades,
I walk through the quiet of the evening glades,
And I leave a space on the path to my right,
For the person who’ll walk there in the light.
I imagine our shoulders brushing by chance,
The start of a long and fated dance,
The way the world will finally settle and sigh,
When "hello" replaces the long "goodbye."
Until that hour, I am a sentry of the soul,
Keeping the fire, making the broken whole,
For I know that the time we spend apart
Is just the porch before the house of the heart.</p>
