    <div class="poem">
      <p>I have not yet held your hand,<br>
      Nor walked with you across the sand.<br>
      But in my heart, you’re already near,<br>
      A gentle voice I long to hear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I dream of you in quiet nights,<br>
      A star that shines with endless light.<br>
      Though I have not yet seen your face,<br>
      I feel your warmth, your gentle grace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>We stand apart, two souls unknown,<br>
      Yet love has found a way to grow.<br>
      No stories shared, no past to bind,<br>
      But still you linger in my mind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I do not know the path you take,<br>
      Or how your mornings gently wake.<br>
      But still I feel you close to me,<br>
      A love that waits patiently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I write to you with hope and care,<br>
      Though I don’t know the clothes you wear.<br>
      I’ve never seen your gentle eyes,<br>
      But still I dream beneath the skies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I wonder how your laughter feels,<br>
      What stories all your silence seals.<br>
      Though I have not yet heard your voice,<br>
      My heart has made its tender choice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’ve never touched your gentle hand,<br>
      Or walked with you across the land.<br>
      But still I feel your spirit near,<br>
      A quiet love that’s crystal clear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I do not know the sound you make,<br>
      Or how your mornings softly wake.<br>
      But still I dream of you each night,<br>
      A gentle flame, a guiding light.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I wonder where your footsteps fall,<br>
      What dreams you chase, what hopes you call.<br>
      Though I have not yet seen your face,<br>
      I feel your warmth, your gentle grace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>I’ve never heard your gentle tone,<br>
      Or walked with you when day is done.<br>
      But still I feel you close to me,<br>
      A love that waits patiently.</p>
